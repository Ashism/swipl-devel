\begin{abstract}
This document describes the SWI-Prolog SSL library, a set of predicates
which provides secure sockets to Prolog applications, for example to run
a secure HTTPS server, or access websites using the \const{https}
protocol.  It can also be used to provide authetification and secure
data exchange between Prolog processes over the network.

\section{Introduction}

\section{Overview of the Prolog API}

An SSL server and client can be built with the following (abstracted)
predicate calls:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
    SSL server    &     SSL client \\
\hline
    ssl_init      &     ssl_init \\
    ssl_socket    &     ssl_socket \\
    ssl_accept    &     ssl_connect \\
    ssl_open      &     ssl_open \\
    \ldots        &     \ldots \\
    ssl_exit      &     ssl_exit
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

What follows is a description of each of these functions and the
arguments they accept.

\begin{description}
    \predicate{ssl_init}{3}{-SSL, +Server, +Options}
Server with legal values \const{server} or \const{client} denotes
whether the SSL socket will have a server or client role in the
established connection. With \arg{Options} various properties of the
TCP/IP + SSL connection can be defined, some of which required, some
optional. An overview is given below. The handle of the connection is
returned in \arg{SSL}.

Below is an overview of the \arg{Options} argument.  Some options are only
required by the client (C), some are required by the server (marked S),
some by both server as client (marked CS). 

\begin{description}
    \termitem{host}{+HostName} [C]
        The host to connect to by the client or identified by the server.
        Both IP addresses and hostnames can be supplied here. This option
        is required for the client and optional for the server.
    \termitem{port}{+Integer} [CS]
        The port to connect or listen to. This option is required since
        no default port can sensibly be defined for an abstract layer.
	The webserver \jargon{https} protocol uses port 443.
    \termitem{certificate_file}{+FileName} [S]
        Specify where the certificate file can be found. This can be the
        same as the key file (see next option).
    \termitem{key_file}{+FileName} [S]
        Specify where the private key can be found. This can be the same
        as the certificate file.
    \termitem{password}{+Text}
        Specify the password the private key is protected with (if any).
	If you do not want to store the password you can also specify
	an application defined handler to return the password
	(see next option).
    \termitem{pem_password_hook}{:PredicateName}
        In case a password is required to access the private key the
        supplied function will be called to fetch it. The function
        has the following prototype: \term{function}{+SSL, -Password}
    \termitem{cacert_file}{+FileName}
        Specify a file containing certificate keys which will thus
        automatically be verified as trusted. You can also install
        an application defined handler to verify certificates (see
        next option).
    \termitem{cert_verify_hook}{:PredicateName}
        In case a certificate cannot be verified or has some properties
        which make it invalid (invalid validity date for example) the
        supplied function will be called to ask its opinion about the
        certificate. The predicate is calles as follows:
	\term{function}{+SSL, +Certificate, +Error}.  Access will be
	granted iff the predicate succeeds.
    \termitem{cert}{+Boolean}
        Trigger the sending of our certificate as specified using
        the option \const{certificate_file} described earlier. For a
        server this option is automatically turned on.
    \termitem{peer_cert}{+Boolean}
        Trigger the request of our peer's certificate while establishing
        the SSL layer. This option is automatically turned on in a client
	SSL socket.
\end{description}

    \predicate{ssl_socket}{2}{+SSL, -Socket}
Initialize the network socket layer.

    \predicate{ssl_accept}{3}{+SSL, +Socket, -Socketinstance} 
Switch the network socket to accept state, opening it for network
connections.

    \predicate{ssl_open}{4}{+SSL, +Socket, -In, -Out}
Attach a Prolog input and output stream to the socket.  The \arg{Socket}
is automatically closed after both streams are closed.  Please note that
the output stream is fully buffered and therefore flush_output/1 is
required to actually send the data to the peer.

    \predicate{ssl_exit}{2}{+SSL}
Clean up all resources related to the SSL + TCP/IP socket layers.
\end{description}

The SWI-Prolog ODBC interface started from a partial interface by
Stefano De Giorgi. Mike Elston suggested programmable
null-representation with many other suggestions while doing the first
field-tests with this package.
