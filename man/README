			SWI-Prolog manual sources


This directory contains the sources to  the SWI-Prolog manual. From this
source we create PDF, HTML and the   plain  text online manual available
through the help/1 and apropos/1 commands.

The *.doc files form the input. The  program doc2tex converts these into
plain LaTeX files. It is responsible   for  handling characters that are
difficult to handle in LaTeX, such as \  and to make references for such
constructs like member/2.

The style file pl.sty ensures _ (underscore) can be used without special
precautions outside math mode.  Do NOT write expand\_file/2, but simply
expand_file/2.


Handling weird characters
-------------------------

Predicate names that cannot be handled by   TeX  due to weird characters
are translated by doc2tex if they appear  as plan LaTeX argument. We use
the URL quoting mechanism for this, producing  sequences that can be use
in any TeX environment (unlike \verb). The sequences are named \S<name>.
If you add such a sequence you must:

	* Add it to doc2tex
	* Add it to pl.sty
	* Add it to ../packages/ltx2html/pl.cmd
	* Add it to ../packages/ltx2html/pl.pl
	* Run "make install" in ../packages/ltx2html

Summaries
---------

For each described predicate  there  MUST  be   an  entry  in  the  file
summary.doc. Note that the content of this file is ordered alphabetical.
