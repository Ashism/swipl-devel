\chapter{Attributed variables}			\label{sec:attvar}

\begin{description}
    \predicate{attvar}{1}{{@}Term}
Succeeds if \arg{Term} is an attributed variable. Note that var/1 also
succeeds on attributed variables.  Attributed variables are created with
put_attr/3.

    \predicate{put_attr}{3}{+Var, +Name, +Value}
If \arg{Var} is a variable or attributed variable, set the value for the
attribute named \arg{Name} to \arg{Value}. If an attribute with this
name is already associated with \var{Var}, the old value is replaced.
Backtracking will restore the old value (i.e.\ an attribute is a mutable
term. See also set_arg/3). This predicate raises a type error if
\arg{Var} is not a variable or \arg{Name} is not an atom.

    \predicate{get_attr}{3}{+Var, +Name, -Value}
Request the current \arg{value} for the attribute named \arg{Name}.  If
\arg{Var} is not an attributed variable or the named attribute is not
associated to \arg{Var} this predicate fails silently.  If \arg{Name}
is not an atom, a type error is raised.

    \predicate{del_attr}{2}{+Var, +Name}
Delete the named attribute.  If \arg{Var} looses its last attribute it
is transformed back into a traditional Prolog variable.  If \arg{Name}
is not an atom, a type error is raised. In all other cases this
predicate succeeds regarless whether or not the named attribute is
present.

\section{Corouting}				\label{sec:corouting}

\begin{description}
    \predicate{freeze}{2}{+Var, :Goal}
Delay the execution of \arg{Goal} until \arg{Var} is bound (i.e. is
not a variable or attributed variable).	 If \arg{Var} is bound on entry
freeze/2 is equivalent to call/1.
\end{description}


\section{Backtrackable global variables}	\label{sec:gvar}

\begin{description}
    \predicate{b_setval}{2}{+Name, +Value}
Associate the term \arg{Value} with the atom \arg{Name} or replaces
the currently associated value with \arg{Value}.  On backtracking the
modifications are reversed, which implies that the variable gets its
old value or ceases to exist.

    \predicate{b_getval}{2}{+Name, -Value}
Get the value associated with the backtrackable global variable
\arg{Name} and unify it with \arg{Value}.  Note that this unification
may further instantiate the value of the global variable.  If this
is undesirable the normal precautions (double negation or copy_term/2)
must be taken.
