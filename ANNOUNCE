SWI-Prolog 5.3.9/XPCE 6.2.17 development snapshot

Status
======
  
  * We do not anticipate more major changes to the kernel in the 5.3.x
    development branch and Prolog programs that do not use the extensions
    appear to run stable.
  
  * The implementation of global variables is new, but few problems are
    expected.

  * Expect problems with builtin predicates handling attributed variables.
    Three types of incorrect behaviour are to be expected: crash (normally
    on an assertion error), refusing to bind (the attvar is treated as a
    instantiated term) or refusing to wakeup the unification handler.
    
Please report all trouble you encounter.


Anticipated features relative to stable 5.2.x release and their status
======================================================================

  * Attributed variables
    Complete.

  * Coroutining.
    Lacking call_residue/2.  Unclear whether this is feasible and
    whether or not we want that.

  * Global variables
    Complete.

  * Infinite terms (cyclic terms)
    Incomplete but useable.

    Supported: =/2, ==/2, @>/2 (and friends), copy_term/2, =../2,
               duplicate_term/2, ground/2, dif/2, when/2, term_variables/2,
	       numbervars/3.

    Unsupported: recorda/2 (and friends), write/1
		 (and friends, partial support), asserta/1 (and friends).

  * CHR constraint language support
    Complete.  Debugger must be integrated with graphical debugger.

  * Domain specific constraint libraries
    Only integer bounds constraint (a subset if CLP(fd)).
    If you have code available or want to develop,
    please contact me (jan@swi-prolog.org).  The aim is to support at
    least the popular solvers compatible to at least one other major
    implementation.


Brief summary of changes since 5.3.8
====================================

SWI-Prolog
----------

  * Fixed some debug-mode issues

  * Made when/2 module aware

  * Turned some traditional printed error messages into exceptions.

Packages
--------

  * CHR: various improvements.  Notably integration in the environment.

  * XPCE: Cleanup of operator issues.  Fixed buffer overflow menus with
    > 1000 entries.

  * Semweb: fix XML output of rdf_save/[1,2] (unquoted attribute).

Development environment
-----------------------

  * Improved reporting of syntax error location.

  * Integrated CHR debugger with Prolog commandline debugger

  * Added CHR mode to PceEmacs for syntax highlighting and
    cross-referencing

  * Limit listing of a module to the predicate actually defined
    in that module (exclude imported predicates).


INCOMPATIBILITIES
=================

  * Exception terms as generated on syntax errors have an additional
    field expressing the line-position of the error.
