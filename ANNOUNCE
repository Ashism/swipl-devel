SWI-Prolog 5.3.15/XPCE 6.2.22 development snapshot

Status
======
  
  * We do not anticipate more major changes to the kernel in the 5.3.x
    development branch and Prolog programs that do not use the extensions
    appear to run stable.
  

Features anticipated in 5.4.x relative to 5.2.x and their status
================================================================

  * Attributed variables
    Complete.

  * Coroutining.
    Lacking call_residue/2.  Unclear whether this is feasible and
    whether or not we want that.

  * Global variables
    Complete.

  * Infinite terms (cyclic terms)
    Incomplete but useable.

    Supported: =/2, ==/2, @>/2 (and friends), copy_term/2, =../2,
               duplicate_term/2, ground/2, dif/2, when/2, term_variables/2,
	       numbervars/3, hash_term/3.

    Unsupported: recorda/2 (and friends), write/1
		 (and friends, partial support), asserta/1 (and friends).

  * CHR constraint language support
    Complete.  Debugger must be integrated with graphical debugger.

  * Domain specific constraint libraries
    Only integer bounds constraint (a subset if CLP(fd)).
    If you have code available or want to develop,
    please contact me (jan@swi-prolog.org).  The aim is to support at
    least the popular solvers compatible to at least one other major
    implementation.

  * JPL: Integrated Java/Prolog interface package
    First integration for Windows and Linux.  There are still many
    configuration issues, documentation integration, some technical
    issues (engine-pool handling in Java --> Prolog, performance and
    API detailsin Prolog --> Java, using the new blob type for Java
    object-references.


Brief summary of changes since 5.3.14
=====================================

SWI-Prolog
----------

  * Fixed .QLF loading leading to "ERROR: Failed to import ... into ..."

  * Added open(pipe(Command), ...) for MS-Windows

  * Report on detached threads terminating on failure or exception.

  * Various minor issues


Packages
--------

  * Semweb: Added triple GC to support applications using rdf_retractall
    often.

  * HTTP library: gracefully handle a large number of exceptions that
    may happen in the server.


Development environment
-----------------------

  * Make the GUI tracer handle threads more elegant.  Still, only
    one thread can have the tracer attached at any time.


INCOMPATIBILITIES
=================

  * Detached threads must succeed or call thread_exit/1.  Failure to
    do so results in a warning message.
