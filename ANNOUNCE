SWI-Prolog 5.3.10/XPCE 6.2.18 development snapshot

Status
======
  
  * We do not anticipate more major changes to the kernel in the 5.3.x
    development branch and Prolog programs that do not use the extensions
    appear to run stable.
  

Anticipated features relative to stable 5.2.x release and their status
======================================================================

  * Attributed variables
    Complete.

  * Coroutining.
    Lacking call_residue/2.  Unclear whether this is feasible and
    whether or not we want that.

  * Global variables
    Complete.

  * Infinite terms (cyclic terms)
    Incomplete but useable.

    Supported: =/2, ==/2, @>/2 (and friends), copy_term/2, =../2,
               duplicate_term/2, ground/2, dif/2, when/2, term_variables/2,
	       numbervars/3.

    Unsupported: recorda/2 (and friends), write/1
		 (and friends, partial support), asserta/1 (and friends).

  * CHR constraint language support
    Complete.  Debugger must be integrated with graphical debugger.

  * Domain specific constraint libraries
    Only integer bounds constraint (a subset if CLP(fd)).
    If you have code available or want to develop,
    please contact me (jan@swi-prolog.org).  The aim is to support at
    least the popular solvers compatible to at least one other major
    implementation.


Brief summary of changes since 5.3.9
====================================

SWI-Prolog
----------

  * Minor patches and cleanup

  * Hide ELF symbols to reduce risc for accidental override, reduce
    startup time, especially when used as embedded shared object.
    ELF-systems compiled with GCC only.

Packages
--------

  * XPCE: Hide ELF symbols.  See above.

  * SGML/XML parser: Fixed buffer overflow.  Added xsdp_types.pl
    (partial support for XSD Primitive Types) and iso_639.pl
    (ISO-639 language codes).

  * RDF: Added support for xml:lang and rdf:dataType

  * Semweb (rdf_db): Added support for xml:lang and rdf:dataType.
    Fixes to rdf_save/2.
