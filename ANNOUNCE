SWI-Prolog 5.4.0/XPCE 6.4.0 stable release

Although there are still various issues  with the current development it
is decided to call it 5.4.0. This   version  is more stable than 5.2.13,
the remaining issues do not  involve  core   components  and  we  do not
anticipate incompatible changes while resolving them.
