SWI-Prolog 5.3.3/XPCE 6.2.14 development snapshot

Status
======
  
  * Variosu users have reported their old programs to run fine on
    this experimental version.

  * Be careful on production systems.  Should be fine for running normal
    Prolog code for development.  Especially =/2, ==/2, @>/2, copy_term/2,
    recorda and friends have been modified significantly to deal with
    cyclic terms and attributed variables.
  
  * The implementation of global variables is new, but few problems are
    expected.

  * Expect problems with builtin predicates handling attributed variables.
    Three types of incorrect behaviour are to be expected: crash (normally
    on an assertion error), refusing to bind (the attvar is treated as a
    instantiated term) or refusing to wakeup the unification handler.
    
Please report all trouble you encounter.
