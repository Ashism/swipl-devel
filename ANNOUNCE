SWI-Prolog 5.3.18/XPCE 6.2.24 development snapshot

Status
======
  
  * We do not anticipate more major changes to the kernel in the 5.3.x
    development branch and Prolog programs that do not use the extensions
    appear to run stable.
  

Features anticipated in 5.4.x relative to 5.2.x and their status
================================================================

  * Attributed variables
    Complete.

  * Coroutining.
    Lacking call_residue/2.  Unclear whether this is feasible and
    whether or not we want that.

  * Global variables
    Complete.

  * Infinite terms (cyclic terms)
    Incomplete but useable.

    Supported: =/2, ==/2, @>/2 (and friends), copy_term/2, =../2,
               duplicate_term/2, ground/2, dif/2, when/2, term_variables/2,
	       numbervars/3, hash_term/3, findall/3, bagof/3, setof/3,
	       recorded database.

    Unsupported: write/1 (and friends, partial support),
		 asserta/1 (and friends).

  * CHR constraint language support
    Complete.  Debugger must be integrated with graphical debugger.

  * Domain specific constraint libraries
    Only integer bounds constraint (a subset if CLP(fd)).
    If you have code available or want to develop,
    please contact me (jan@swi-prolog.org).  The aim is to support at
    least the popular solvers compatible to at least one other major
    implementation.

  * JPL: Integrated Java/Prolog interface package
    First integration for Windows and Linux.  There are still many
    configuration issues, documentation integration, some technical
    issues (engine-pool handling in Java --> Prolog, performance and
    API detailsin Prolog --> Java, using the new blob type for Java
    object-references.


Brief summary of changes since 5.3.16
=====================================

SWI-Prolog
----------

  * Add goal expansion for Module:Goal goals.

Packages
--------

  * RDF: MODIFIED: The raw RDF parser as implemented by load_rdf/3 now
    returns all resources as atoms rather than some as NameSpace:Local.

  * HTTP: Various patches and additions.

  * XPCE: Fixed buffer overrun-by-one problem in menu handling, which
    caused crashes in the Windows version (and possibly others, depending
    on the compiler and optimization).

Development environment
-----------------------
