# Debian dependency list as compiled by Nicolas Pelletier
################################################################

List of packages needed to compile SWI Prolog on Debian 4.0 stable (Etch):

binutils
coreutils
gcc
grep
libc6-dev
libgmp3-dev
libncursesw5-dev
libreadline5-dev
autoconf
make
sed
curl
chrpath

List of packages needed to compile additional SWI Prolog packages on
Debian 4.0 stable (Etch):

For clib: no other package required
For cpp: no other package required
For odbc: unixodbc-dev
For table: no other package required
For xpce: libxext-dev libice-dev libjpeg62-dev libxinerama-dev libxft-dev
libxpm-dev libxt-dev pkg-config
For sgml: no other package required
For sgml/RDF: no other package required
For semweb: no other package required
For http: no other package required
For chr: no other package required
For clpqr: no other package required
For nlp: no other package required
For ssl: libssl-dev
For pldoc: no other package required
For plunit: no other package required
For jpl: sun-java5-bin sun-java5-fonts sun-java5-jdk
For zlib: zlib1g-dev

Note 1: installing these packages triggers the automatic installation
of other needed (dependent) packages.
Note 2: Debian includes other Java implementations; however, the
configure script found in jpl tests for a directory structure that can
only match Sun's Java. I also do not know if the jpl package works
with these other implementations. Now that Sun has open-sourced Java,
this should be less of a concern.

------------------------
And now simple commands:
------------------------

To make life a bit easier for you we compiled a single-line apt-get
command to get all SWI-Prolog's dependencies.  Simply copy-and-paste
the command below in a terminal window and enter the sudo password
to get everything installed.  Note that it does not matter than you
may have some of these packages already present: apt-get will simply
tell you they are installed and up-to-date.

sudo apt-get install \
	binutils coreutils gcc grep chrpath \
	libc6-dev libncursesw5-dev libreadline5-dev \
	libgmp3-dev \
	make sed autoconf curl \
	libxext-dev libice-dev libjpeg62-dev libxinerama-dev libxft-dev \
	libxpm-dev libxt-dev pkg-config \
	libssl-dev \
	openjdk-6-jdk \
	zlib1g-dev

The provided build.templ works fine for Debian and Ubuntu. Copy it to
"build" and edit the installation prefix if you do not wish to install
in your own $HOME/bin directory.  Then run

	./build

--------------------------
Building the documentation
--------------------------

If you want to build the documentation from source you also need the
following packages:

	sudo apt-get install \
		texlive-latex-base \
		texlive-latex-recommended \
		texlive-fonts-recommended

# OpenSUSE 11.2
################################################################

For OpenSuSE 11.2, you need the following installed in addition
to the basic X11/C/C++ development profile:

zypper install \
	git-core \
	readline-devel \
	unixODBC-devel \
	libjpeg-devel \
	java-1_6_0-openjdk-devel
